Of course. Here is the complete, consolidated set of instructions for Jules to execute.

### **Log Entry: 2025-06-20 07:58 AM**

**Objective:** Execute a full refactor of the `kranos-reporter` codebase to align it perfectly with the established architectural design and specifications.

**Jules, execute the following instructions precisely and in the order presented.**

---

### **Phase 1: Refactor Foundational Layers**

**Task 1.1: Update `reporter/database.py`**
* **Instruction:** Append the `initialize_database` function, as defined in the build guide, to the end of the file. This function is essential for creating the database schema on application startup. - DONE

**Task 1.2: Update `reporter/main.py`**
* **Instruction:** Modify the `main` function. Before the `app.run()` call, add a call to `initialize_database()` to ensure the database tables are created. The function should now have two lines in it. - DONE

---

### **Phase 2: Refactor the Data Access Layer (`database_manager.py`)**

**Context:** This is a critical step. We must ensure this layer communicates using the standardized dataclasses from `models.py`, not raw database tuples.

**Task 2.1: Refactor all functions in `reporter/database_manager.py`** - DONE
* **Instruction 1 (Connection Factory):** In the `get_connection` function, insert the line `conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row` before `return conn`.
* **Instruction 2 (Return Types):** Modify all data retrieval functions (`get_all_members`, `get_all_group_plans`, etc.) to return lists of the corresponding dataclass objects (e.g., `List[Member]`). You will use a list comprehension like `[Member(**row) for row in cursor.fetchall()]`.
* **Instruction 3 (Input & Return Logic):** Modify all data creation functions (`add_member`, `add_group_plan`, etc.) to:
    1.  Accept a dataclass object as their single argument (e.g., `def add_member(member: Member)`).
    2.  Use the attributes of this object in the `cursor.execute` call (e.g., `member.name`, `member.email`).
    3.  After `conn.commit()`, set the ID on the passed object (`member.id = cursor.lastrowid`) and return the modified object.
* **Outcome Summary:**
    *   Successfully refactored existing CRUD functions in `database_manager.py` to use dataclasses from `models.py` for inputs and outputs.
    *   `conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row` was set in `DatabaseManager.__init__` as `get_connection` was not present in the file.
    *   New dataclasses (`Member`, `GroupPlan`, `GroupClassMembership`, `PTMembership`) were created in `models.py`.
    *   Noted that several functions listed in the original Task 2.1 instructions were not present in `database_manager.py` (e.g., `get_member_by_id`, most payment-related functions, session/attendance functions). The refactoring was applied to all applicable, existing functions.

---

### **Phase 3: Refactor the Business Logic Layer (`app_api.py`)**

**Context:** This layer must contain all business logic and act as the sole intermediary between the UI and the data access layer.

**Task 3.1: Refactor all functions in `reporter/app_api.py` - DONE**
* **Instruction 1 (Signatures):** Update all function signatures to match the build guide exactly. For example, `add_new_member` should accept `name`, `email`, `phone`, and `join_date` as separate arguments.
* **Instruction 2 (Object Creation):** Inside each `add_new_*` function, create the appropriate dataclass instance from `models.py` using the function's arguments.
* **Instruction 3 (Business Logic):** Implement the core business logic. Specifically, in `add_new_group_class_membership`, calculate the `end_date` by adding the plan's `duration_days` to the `start_date`.
* **Instruction 4 (Data Calls):** Ensure every function calls the corresponding function in `database_manager` and returns its result.
* **Outcome Summary for Task 3.1:**
    *   All functions in `reporter/app_api.py` were refactored to align with the build guide and use dataclasses from `models.py`.
    *   Function signatures were updated for clarity and to accept specific typed arguments (e.g., `name: str, email: str, phone: str, join_date: str` for `add_member`) and return dataclass objects or lists thereof (e.g., `Optional[models.Member]`).
    *   `add_*` functions (e.g., `add_member`, `add_group_plan`, `create_group_class_membership`, `create_pt_membership`) now instantiate the corresponding dataclass from `models.py` using their input arguments.
    *   Business logic within `create_group_class_membership` (formerly `add_new_group_class_membership`) for calculating `end_date` (using `plan_details.duration_days` and `start_date`) and determining `membership_type` (by checking existing memberships) was implemented.
    *   In `create_pt_membership`, `sessions_remaining` is now initialized to `sessions_total` upon object creation.
    *   All `app_api.py` functions now correctly call their corresponding `database_manager.py` functions, passing dataclass objects where the `database_manager` expects them (e.g., for add and update operations), and returning the results.
    *   Update functions in `app_api.py` (like `update_member`, `update_group_plan`, `update_group_class_membership`, `update_pt_membership`) construct and pass the relevant model object to `database_manager`. For `update_member` and `update_group_plan`, `None` values for optional fields are handled gracefully by `database_manager`. For `update_group_class_membership` and `update_pt_membership`, `database_manager` expects complete objects, so AppAPI signatures were adjusted to ensure all necessary data is provided to construct these objects.
    *   It is noted that `payment_method` and `notes` attributes within the `models.GroupClassMembership` dataclass are handled in `app_api.py` but are not currently persisted to the database by the existing `database_manager.add_group_class_membership` or `database_manager.update_group_class_membership` methods.

---

### **Phase 4: Refactor the UI Layer (`streamlit_ui/app.py`)**

**Context:** The UI must be completely decoupled from the data access layer. It should only ever communicate with the `app_api`.

**Task 4.1: Refactor all functions in `reporter/streamlit_ui/app.py`**
* **Instruction 1 (API Calls):** Go through the entire file. Find every call to `database_manager` and replace it with a call to the equivalent function in `app_api`. For example, a call to `database_manager.get_all_members()` must be changed to `app_api.get_all_members()`.
* **Instruction 2 (Data Handling):** Adjust the UI code to correctly handle the dataclass objects now being returned by the `app_api` layer. For example, when displaying members in a table, you will now access data via attributes (`member.name`, `member.email`) instead of by index.
- **Outcome Summary:** Task already completed. `reporter/streamlit_ui/app.py` was found to be already using `app_api` and handling dataclass objects correctly. No changes were made during this task. - DONE

---

### **Phase 5: Final Verification**

**Task 5.1: Format the Codebase**
* **Instruction 1:** Run `isort reporter/` from the root directory.
* **Instruction 2:** Run `black reporter/` from the root directory.
- **Outcome Summary:** Codebase successfully formatted using `isort` and `black` after resolving parsing issues in `reporter/database_manager.py` by refactoring `try...except` blocks. - DONE

**Task 5.2: System Test**
* **Instruction:** Run the application using `streamlit run reporter/main.py`. Verify that all tabs load and that you can add a new member, a new plan, and a new membership without errors.
- **Outcome Summary:** Application starts successfully via `streamlit run reporter/main.py` after installing Streamlit. Full UI interaction tests (tab navigation, data entry) could not be performed due to execution environment limitations. Considered DONE within constraints. - DONE

Execute these phases in order. This will bring the entire application into alignment with our architectural standard.
