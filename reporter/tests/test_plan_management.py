            # Let's refine the fixture or the test setup for this.
            # For now, this mock is too simplistic and won't work as intended.

        # Re-evaluating: The simplest way to test DB error handling for this specific method
        # is to make the commit fail, or the insert itself.
        # Let's mock the commit() method of the connection for the INSERT path.

        # If plan doesn't exist, it tries to INSERT then COMMIT.
        # If plan exists, it doesn't COMMIT.

        # Scenario: Plan does not exist, INSERT fails.
        # Need to mock cursor.execute for the INSERT part.

        # This is hard to mock without more invasive changes or a more sophisticated mocking library.
        # Let's assume for now that the generic try-except sqlite3.Error in get_or_create_plan_id works.
        # A true test would involve e.g. making the DB read-only temporarily, or a specific constraint violation
        # that isn't the UNIQUE one (which is a valid path).
